 * A uoe-api is a potentially indeterminstic function that may have side effects. It is the least-restrictive concept of a function.
 *
 * An api does not take in any further arguments, and can merely be executed.
 *
 * If input data must be provided, a map can be used which then returns an api to be executed, kind of like currying.
 *
 * If calling a map with no arguments returns an api, this api will be implicitely executed. This means a map can still expose indeterminism, provided it is understood that an api return value is expected.
