/**
 * @stability 1 - experimental
 *
 * Produces an `:error` enum instance representing an error caused by an implementation detail. It cannot be determined whether partial execution has occured unless there is a policy that specifies otherwise in this interface's contract. While the error is considered an implementation detail through this interface, there is nothing preventing a different error type from being emitted in a supplementary or alternative interface where this error might not be treated as an implementation detail.
 *
 * The optional `cause` allows the developer to keep track of the origin of the error and maintain an error chain. This must be another uoe-error. The optional `ref` allows the user to obtain details for this error in a supplementary interface if available and must be universally unique. The user is expected to know how to interact with such a supplementary interface if one is provided. A supplementary interface is especially useful if a cause chain must be maintained that does not involve uoe-errors, such as native JavaScript exceptions.
