/**
 * @stability 1 - experimental
 *
 * Creates a monolithic multi-lock where granular scopes can be acquired to increase throughput.
 *
 * A single multi-lock is not prone to deadlocks as all scopes are acquired and released in a single atomic operation.
 *
 * Overlapping acquisitions are performed sequentially to prevent starvation of older requests.
 *
 * Invoke `create_scope` to create a new scope.
 *
 * Pass an array of scopes alongside a callback to `acquire` to make an acquisition request.
