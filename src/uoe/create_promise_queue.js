/**
 * @stability 2 - provisional
 *
 * Allows you to await a bunch of promises while adding additional promises to the queue which are subsequently awaited too.
 *
 * The `add` method takes in a promise and adds this promise to the queue.
 *
 * The `all` method returns a promise that resolves when all promises in the queue have resolved.
 *
 * At the time `all` is first called, all `all` calls will resolve at any point that all promises in the queue are in the resolved state.
 *
 * Adding promises to the queue after resolution is equivalent to starting fresh with a new promise queue, the existing promises are swept from the queue after resolution.
